# dotfiles
1. general settings 


2. a scuffed personal arch install (not a script more like a part automator) with my very limitied knowledge
    IMPORTANT:
        Only to my likings, e.g. lang, username, time, home&root in one partition, etc
        You cant install arch just with the script
    
    instructions:
    pacman -Sy git
    git clone git://github.com/liwilz/dotfiles
    
        testing ip, disk partitioning, mirrors(pacman.d/mirrorlist) password
